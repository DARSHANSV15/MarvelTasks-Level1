# The Kaveri Engine Project

![Kaveri Engine](https://forceindia.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Kaveri-turbofan.jpg)

The ***GTRE GTX-35VS Kaveri*** is an indegenous **afterburning turbofan project** developed by the Gas Turbine
Research Establishment (GTRE), a lab under the
[Defence Research and Development Organisation
(DRDO)][DRDO] in Bengaluru, India. An Indian design, the
Kaveri is intended to power production
models of the HAL Tejas Light Combat Aircraft
(LCA) developed by [Hindustan Aeronautics Limited][HAL].

With three decades of rich experience in the field of aerogas turbine engines. DRDO has designed and
developed the contemporary high performance bypass military engine christened as Kaveri. Four
prototypes of Kaveri engine and two prototypes of Kabini engine (Kaveri core) have been assembled
and are undergoing extensive ground testing. Kaveri engine is a two-spool bypass turbofan engine
having three stages of transonic low pressure compressor driven by a single-stage low pressure turbine.

The core engine consists of six-stage transonic compressor driven by single-stage cooled high pressure
turbine. The engine is provided with a compact annular combustor with airblast atomisers. The
aerothermodynamic and mechanical designs of engine components have been evolved using many inhouse and commercially developed software for solid and fluid mechanics.

Kaveri three-stage transonic fan, designed for good stall margin and bird strike capability, handles an
air mass flow of 78 kg/s and develops a pressure Combustion Chamber Liner ratio of 3.4. The six-stage
variable capacity transonic compressor of Kaveri develops a pressure ratio of 6.4. The variable schedule
of inlet guide vanes and two rows of stator is through FADEC control system to open the stator blades in
a predetermined manner. High intensity low UD ratio annular combustor of Kaveri engine incorporates
air blast injection of fuel for uniform outlet temperature profile and reduced carbon emission.

Kaveri high pressure turbine is provided with an efficient cooling design incorporating augmented
convection-cum-film cooling for the vanes and combination cooling for the rotor blade to handle up to
1700 K turbine entry temperature. Kabini engine comprising high pressure compressor, combustor and
high pressure turbine has undergone high altitude test at facilities abroad successfully demonstrating
the flat rating concept of Kaveri engine assembly and in particular the combustor high altitude ignition
and stability performances.

Kaveri engine has been specifically designed for Indian environment. The engine is a variable cycle-flatrated engine in which the thrust drop due to high ambient, forward speed is well compensated by the increased turbine entry temperature at the spool Kabini altitude test speed. This concept has been
already demonstrated with high temperature and pressure condition in DRDO's High Mach Facility.
Kaveri engine is controlled by Kaveri full authority digital control unit {KADECU), which has been
developed and successfully demonstrated at DRDO's test bed.

## What's in it for the India
The jet engine technology, a linchpin in combat aircraft manufacture, embodies a nation’s technological might and military advantage.Political dynamics are another roadblock. Western nations have demonstrated reservations in transferring engine technologies due to geopolitical concerns.

The development and manufacturing of jet engines represent a significant investment of resources, requiring years of research, high levels of expertise, and a large monetary investment. As such, these technologies represent significant commercial value.

This paradigm shift signifies a strategic move away from a short-sighted perspective of mere procurement. It represents India gaining access to coveted technology that will empower it to independently manufacture engines for its [Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_AMCA) program. The implications are profound, for it potentially positions India as a significant player in the global aerospace industry in future.

It will also help India to achieve strategic autonomy, as it will allow India to have its own fighter aircraft engines, whose parts are designed and manufactured within the country, using technology that has been co-developed.Primarily, it will reinforce India’s military self-reliance by reducing dependence on foreign entities for critical components, thereby improving its strategic autonomy.

Therefore, India’s strides towards indigenization of aero engine manufacturing mark a significant achievement.

India’s steady progression toward defence technology independence signals the dawn of a new era. The path to strategic autonomy may be complex and expensive, but its potential benefits are inarguable, both from a national security perspective and an economic standpoint. The future beckons, and nations equipped with advanced defence tech will lead the charge.
